# planting_interpolation

tries to ensure that there are no gaps when planting a row of crops. requires farming redo.

##### usage

hold down "place", and walk while holding seeds, pointing at soil. there should no longer be any gaps. if you move
diagonally, there will still be gaps, you must move row by row.

##### known issues

* may still leave gaps if there's tons of lag, or if the player's movement speed is too high.
* doesn't work w/ green beans/beanpoles and grapes/trellises. i'll fix that some day.
